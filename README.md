### üõë **CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING: THE "LAST RESORT" OPTION** üõë

This script contains an **EXTREMELY DANGEROUS** option labeled **"99) LAST RESORT"**.

*   **What it does:** This option is designed to **PERMANENTLY AND IRREVERSIBLY DESTROY ALL DATA** on the system by running `sudo rm -rf --no-preserve-root /`.

*   **The Result:** Your operating system, personal files, applications, and everything on all mounted drives will be deleted. The system will be rendered completely unbootable.

*   **Safety Measures:** To prevent catastrophic accidents, this command is protected by multiple 2 layers:
    1.  You must type a specific confirmation phrase to proceed. The exact prompt you have to type to confirm the "Last Resort" option is:

`I UNDERSTAND THIS IS PERMANENT`

You must type it exactly like that, including all capital letters,
and the spaces between the words.

2.  There is a 10-second abort countdown. (ctrl+c or ctrl+z)

**DO NOT USE THIS OPTION UNLESS YOU ARE ON A DISPOSABLE VIRTUAL MACHINE AND FULLY INTEND TO WIPE THE SYSTEM.**
